# The Inner Workings of StatusZer0
This strange creature appears to be lacking sleep, and appears to be a programmer. It uses Unity to develop games, but not very often due to a lack of skill, motivation, and ideas.
It is most experienced in C#, and is learning how to program in Python, Lua, Haxe, and despite hating it, C++.

# Activity
It sometimes like to mod games, specifically Minecraft and Geometry Dash.
It has made 2 mods for Geometry Dash, that being "Drunk Mode" and "Ultra LDM", with "Drunk Mode" being quite popular, which is very, VERY surprising according to StatusZer0.
While making 3 public mods to Minecraft with Mcreator, it is actively learning how to mod with Fabric, with a lack of ideas and large lack of skill in that area.

# Ideas
It would appreciate people giving it ideas on what to do, as it can get quite bored.
It would most like ideas for modding Geometry Dash and Minecraft, as it wants to expand greatly in those fields.
